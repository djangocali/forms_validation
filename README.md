# forms_validation

You can just clone the repository and see the examples at the following urls:
- localhost:8000 #No validation flow
- localhost:8000/server-validation/ #Server side validation
- localhost:8000/csv_display/ # Using forms for validation from other sources

It requires having Django installed. That's the only dependency.
